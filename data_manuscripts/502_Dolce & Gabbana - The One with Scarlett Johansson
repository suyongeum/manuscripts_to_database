I love Italy
I had an Italian boyfriend once his mother broke up with me
How do I know it was a lie because I read it in your newspaper
Well a girl has to have a private life keeps the public interested
Music inspires me Art inspires me But so does the wind
Yes I can really sing But you have to pay me first
Ah my favorite part of my body I like my lips for kissing and for words that start with the letter M
Calm slows down time But a moment can last forever 
I do all my own stunts Even lovemaking
Oh I've played a physicist a nanny a surgeon an actress a cannibal a spy
Actress is the hardest Because you never know who you are
I'm not an actress I just play one in the movies
Yes I can cry on cue but third take that's for real
The smell of sunshine is the best You know what I mean
Oh I'm not looking for a million things just that one perfect thing Love 
That's the one Dolce and Gabbana The One
