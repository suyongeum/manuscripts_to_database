I've actually always found something that to be very true which is
most people don't get those experiences because they never ask
I've never found anybody that didn't want to help me if I ask them for help
I always call him up I called up a little date me but I call that bill hewlett when I was 12 years old
and he lived in palo alto his number was still in the phone book
and he answered the phone himself I'd said yes
hi I'm steve jobs and 12 years old I'm a student in high school
and I want to build a frequency counter and I was wondering if you had any spare parts I could have
and he laughed and he gave me the spare parts of all the frequency counters and he gave me a job that summer in hewlett packard
working on the assembly line putting nuts and bolts together on frequency counters he got me a job in the place that built them
and I was in heaven and I've never found anyone who said no or hung up the phone when I call I just asked
and when people ask me I try to be as responsive as to pay that that debt of gratitude back
most people never pick up the phone call most people never asked and that's what separates
sometimes the people to do things from the people that just dream about them
you got it act and you've got to be willing to fail you've got to be willing crash and burn
you know with people on the phone with starting a company with whatever
if you're afraid of failing you won't get very far
