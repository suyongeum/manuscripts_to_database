moving across the country has been great for me
I don't know if I could say the same for my parents
It's the worst thing that has ever happened to them
I'm just pretty much killing it out here
they say they are happy
I mean what do you think they do everyday without me there
are they eating
they must really miss me i'm their only child except for my sister
