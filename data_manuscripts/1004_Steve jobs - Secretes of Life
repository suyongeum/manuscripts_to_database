So the thing I would say is when you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is
your life is just to live your life inside the world try not to bash into the walls too much try to have a nice family life have fun save a little money
But life that's a very limited life Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact
And that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you
And you can change it You can influence it you can build your own things that other people can use
And the minute you understand that you can poke life and actually something will push in something will pop out the other side you can change it you can mold it
That's maybe the most important thing It's to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you're just going to live in it
versus embrace it change it improve it make your mark upon it
I think that's very important And however you learn that once you learn it
you'll want to change life and make it better because it's kind of messed up in a lot of ways
Once you learn that you'll never be the same again
