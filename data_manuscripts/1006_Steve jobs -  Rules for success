people say you have to have a lot of passion for what you're doing
and it's totally true and the reason is because it's so hard
but if you don't any rational person would give up
it's really hard and you have to do it over a sustained period of time
so if you don't love it if you don't have fun doing it and you don't really love it you're gonna give up
and that's what happens to most people actually if you really look at the ones that ended up you know being successful unquote in the eyes of society and the ones that didn't 
oftentimes it's the ones that are successful love what they did so like persevere
when you know it got really tough and the ones that didn't love it quit
because they're sane right who would wanna put up with this stuff if you don't love it
so it's a lot of hard work and it's a lot of worrying constantly
and if you don't love it you're gonna fail so you've gotta love it you've gotta have passion
and I think that's the high order bit
the second thing is you've gotta be a really good talent scout
cause no matter how smart you are you need a team of great people
and you've gotta figure out how to size people up fairly quickly make decisions without knowing people too well
and hire them and you know see how you do and refine your intuition
and be able to help you know build an organization that can eventually just build itself
because you need great people around you
