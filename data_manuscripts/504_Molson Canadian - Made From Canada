When you think about canadians you might ask yourself why are we the way we are
What the answer is laying right under our feet literaly
The fact is it's this land that shapes us
There's a reason why we would run off the dock instead of tippy toe in
it's because that water is frozen six months a year
and that frozen water brought on a sport that we can call our own
This land is unlike any other
we have more squre feet of awesomeness per person than any other nation on earth
It's why we are flocked toward lakes mountains forests rivers and streams
we know we have the best backyard in the world
And we get out there every chance we get
because it's not just the great outdoors were chasing its's freedom
And this place gives it to us every turn
Here we are free to chill out free to unwind and free to wind up
There is a beer that comes from the same land we let loose on
And it proves to be a clean crispin fresh as the country it comes from
so here's the everything this land gives us Molson Canadian Made from Canada
