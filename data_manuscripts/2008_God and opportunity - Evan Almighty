Excuse me can I get a refill please
Coming right up
Execuse me are you all right
No it's a long story
Well I like stories
I'm considered a bit of a storyteller myself
My husband do you know New York's mellow
The guy who's builidng the ark
That's him
I love that story Noah and the Ark
You know a lot of people miss the point of that story
They think it's about God's wrath and anger
Their luminance is God gets angry
What is the story about then the Ark
I think it's a love story about believing in each other
You don't have animals show up in pairs
They stood by each other side by side just like Noah and his family
Everybody entered the ark side by side
By my husband says God told him to do it
What do you do with that
Sound like an opportunity
Let's me ask you something
If someone prays for patience you think God gives them patience
Or does he give them the opportunity to be patient
If you pray for courage just got you courage as give my opportunity to be courageous
If someone prayed for family to be closer
do you think God zaps them with warm fuzzy feelings
what does it feel them opportunities to love each either
Well I got to run a lot of people to server Enjoy
