Master Oogway You summoned me Is something wrong
Why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend
So nothing's wrong
Well I didn't say that
You were saying
I have had a vision Tai Lung will return
That is impossible He is in prison
Nothing is impossible
Zeng fly to chogun prison and tell them to double the guards double the weapons double everything tai lung does not leave that prison
Yes master shifu
One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it
We have to do something We can't just let him march on the valley and take his revenge He'll he'll
Your mind is like this water my friend When it is agitated it becomes difficult to see
But if you allow it to settle that answer becomes clear
The dragon scroll
It is time
But who who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power To become the dragon warrior
I don't know
