In the morning you're making a movie and get up really early
So you need all the all the help you can get
When I'm reading the script when I'm rehearsing coffee brews with my line of work

I'm going to feel awkward I'm not going to feel the same
Most of my scripts have coffee stains off That's how you know it's a pacino script
This is good coffee
