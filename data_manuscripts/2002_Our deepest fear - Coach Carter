our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate
our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure
it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us
your playing small does not serve the world
there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other peopole won't feel insecure around you
we're all meant to shine as children do
it's not just in some of us it's in everyone
and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same
as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
sir I just wanna say thank you you saved my life
