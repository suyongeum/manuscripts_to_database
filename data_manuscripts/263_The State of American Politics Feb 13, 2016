I'm speaking to you today from Springfield Illinois
I spent eight years in the state senate here
It was a place where for all our surface differences in a state as diverse as Illinois
my colleagues and I actually shared a lot in common
We fought for our principles and voted against each other
but because we assumed the best in one another not the worst
we found room for progress
We bridged differences to get things done
In my travels through this state I saw most Americans do the same
Folks know that issues are complicated and that people with different ideas might have a point
It convinced me that if we just approached our politics the same way we approach our daily lives
with common sense a commitment to fairness
and the belief that we're all in this together there's nothing we can not do
That's why I announced right here in Springfield that I was running for President
And my faith in the generosity and fundamental goodness of the American people is rewarded affirmed every single day
But I'll be the first to admit that the tone of our politics hasn't gotten better but worse
Too many people feel like the system is rigged and their voices don't matter
And when good people are pushed away from participating in our public life
more powerful and extreme voices will fill the void
They'll be the ones who gain control over decisions that could send a young soldier to war
or allow another economic crisis or roll back the rights that generations of Americans have fought to secure
The good news is there's also a lot we can do about this
from reducing the influence of money in our politics
to changing the way we draw congressional districts
to simply changing the way we treat each other
That's what I came back here to talk about this week
And I hope you check out my full speech at WhiteHouse.gov
One thing I focused on for example was how we can make voting easier
not harder and modernize it for the way we live now
Here in Illinois a new law allows citizens to register and vote at the polls on Election Day
It also expands early voting which makes it much easier for working folks and busy parents
We're also considering automatic voter registration for every citizen when they apply for a driver's license
And I'm calling on more states to adopt steps like these
Because when more of us vote the less captive our politics will be to narrow interests
and the better our democracy will be for our children
Nine years after I first announced for this office
I still believe in a politics of hope
And for all the challenges of a changing world for all the imperfections of our democracy
choosing a politics of hope is something that's entirely up to each of us
