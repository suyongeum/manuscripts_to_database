Hi everybody On Tuesday I gave my final State of the Union Address
And a focus was this how do we make the new economy work better for everyone
not just those at the top After the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes
we're in the midst of the longest streak of private sector job growth in our history
More than 14 million new jobs An unemployment rate cut in half
At the same time our economy continues to go through profound changes that began long before the Great Recession hit
It's changed to the point where even when folks have jobs
even when the economy is growing it's harder for hardworking families to pull themselves out of poverty
harder for young people to start out on their careers
and tougher for workers to retire when they want to
That's a big part of the reason a lot of working families are feeling anxious
And it offends our fundamentally American belief that everybody who works hard should be able to get ahead
That's why we've been fighting so hard to give families more opportunity and more security
by working to create more good jobs invest in our middle class and help working people get a raise
that's what the Affordable Care Act is all about
filling in the gaps in employer based care so that when somebody loses a job
or goes back to school or starts that new business they still have health care
And it's why I believe we've got to take steps to modernize our unemployment insurance system
If a hardworking American loses her job regardless of what state she lives in
we should make sure she can get unemployment insurance and some help to retrain for her next job
If she's been unemployed for a while we should reach out to her and connect her with career counseling
And if she finds a new job that doesn't pay as much as her old one
we should offer some wage insurance that helps her pay her bills
Under my plan experienced workers who now make less than $50000 could replace half of their lost wages up to $10000 over two years
It's a way to give families some stability and encourage folks to rejoin the workforce
because we shouldn't just be talking about unemployment we should be talking about reemployment
That's when America works best when everyone has opportunity when everyone has some security and when everyone can contribute to this country we love
That's how we make sure that hardworking families can get ahead
And that's what I'll be fighting for with every last day of my presidency
